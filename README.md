# Word-Py
Word-Py is a simple word guessing game that is based on the same idea as the popular game "Wordle". The user must guess the random 5 letter word within 6 tries and they will be given hints as they play. After each guess the user is provided with color coded blocks which let them know if their chosen letters are correct and in the right position.

The game is a mixture of luck and logic. Not only does it allow the user to improve their problem solving skills but also gives them five minutes "timeout" to escape the stressors of everyday life.
